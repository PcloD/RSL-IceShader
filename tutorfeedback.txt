- Look at marble
  Noise to a power

- Superquad displacement shader
  Crease subdiv

- Report : Talk about stuff we don't already know
  Used subdiv rather than polys
  Used displacement shader rather than modeling
  Focused on particles not fluids
  ~Decisions~ Why did you make the decision?
  Focus on interesting bits -> Tried & failed etc
  Part 4 -> Analysis/Results
   Performance
   Improvement
   etc
  "I should have done" don't put it at the end/conclusion, put in analysis
  Short conclusion at the end, focus on positives, no new stuff mentioned

 Show things in video that can't be shown in report, big ideas
